       ratings, price, marketing, and theater distribution network - all

       global audience. We are motivated to analyze movie trends,
       statistics, and logistics such as calculating the highest
       revenue and budget by year, comparing runtime v.s. budget/revenue/etc,
       comparing vote average v.s. vote count, and many more comparisions.
