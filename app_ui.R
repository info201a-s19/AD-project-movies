       stub at the theater as there are many components before and after
       movie releases. Some pre-release factors consisting of budgeting,
       timeline, and production planning enhance the quality and
       enjoyability of the movie. While, a few post-factors incorporate
       ratings, price, marketing, and theater distribution network - all
       of which aim to drive long-term profitability and to attract a
       global audience. We are motivated to analyze movie trends,
       statistics, and logistics such as calculating the highest
       revenue and budget by year, comparing runtime v.s. budget/revenue/etc,
       comparing vote average v.s. vote count, and many more comparisions.

       budget, revenue, runtime, vote count, vote average, popularity, and
       release year that are associated with them."),
